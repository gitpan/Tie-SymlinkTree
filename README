Tie::SymlinkTree Version 1.0
============================

This package started out as a simple persistant storage module, but
it's scope has broadened a bit: The included Tie::Indexer is a
generic module for searching through nested hashes and speeding up
these searches via on-disk hashes, it is not limited to
Tie::SymlinkTree.

Read 'perldoc Tie::SymlinkTree' and/or 'perldoc Tie::Indexer' for details.
